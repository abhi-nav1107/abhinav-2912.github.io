Hello! I am Abhinav. I am currently pursuing Bachelors and Masters in Technology in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/mat/courses/idd) at [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/). I enjoy researching and applying techniques from the area of Machine Leaning, Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I also like to spend time on problems related to data structres and algorithms.

I am currently working with [Dr. Sunil Kumar]() on anomaly detection in medical images using Generative Adversarial Network techniques. In the previous semester, I worked on bleeding image segmentation, critically analysing various approaches and developing my own. Last summer, I worked with [Distributed Red Hen Lab](http://www.redhenlab.org/) under [Mahnaz Parian](https://dbis.dmi.unibas.ch/team/mahnaz-amiri-parian/) on Hand Gesture Detection. Prior to that, I spent a summer at IIT Roorkee, working on single image rain removal.
