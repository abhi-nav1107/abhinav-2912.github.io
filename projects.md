<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;">**Anomaly Detection in Polyp Images**</span>
* The task here is similar to segmentation of polyps in images. Implementing various approaches based on generative adversarial networks and executing them on this dataset. (in progress)

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;">**Polyp Segmentation in WCE Images**</span>
* Developed a u-net based network for segmenting polyps. Also, compared the performances of state-of-the-art models on this private dataset. [github](https://github.com/abhinav-2912/Polyp-Segmentation)

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;">**Gesture Detection**</span>
* Implemented a sliding window based method consisting of detector and classifier as part of GSoC 2019. Also, developed a singularity container for code deployment. [github](https://github.com/abhinav-2912/Gesture-Detection)

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;">**Bleeding Detection in WCE Images**</span>
* Developed three approaches based on SIFT keypoints descriptors, Dense SIFT and Sparse Coding for automated bleeding detection in wireless capsule endscopy (WCE) images. [github](https://github.com/abhinav-2912/Bleeding-Detection)

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;">**Rain and Haze Removal**</span>

* Designed an autoencoder based CNN network for rain removal and used dark channel prior method for haze removal. [github](https://github.com/abhinav-2912/Rain-Haze-Removal)

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1.2em;">**Fiducial Marker Localization**</span>
* Developed an algorithm, for finding coordinates of fiducials in MRI scans, based on image processing techniques and clustering methods. It was a team event at 6th Inter IIT Tech Meet 2018. [github](https://github.com/abhinav-2912/Fiducial-Localization)
